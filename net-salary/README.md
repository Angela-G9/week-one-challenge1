# Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)

This program calculates an individualâ€™s **Net Salary** based on the following inputs:

- **Basic Salary**: The employee's base salary before any deductions.
- **Benefits**: Additional benefits provided to the employee (optional, can be zero).
  
The program will calculate:

- **Gross Salary**: The total salary before deductions (Basic Salary + Benefits).
- **PAYE (Tax)**: Based on the KRA progressive tax rates.
- **NHIF Deductions**: Based on the NHIF deduction rates.
- **NSSF Deductions**: A fixed percentage (6%) of the gross salary for NSSF.

Finally, the **Net Salary** is computed after applying the deductions. The values are formatted for readability.
