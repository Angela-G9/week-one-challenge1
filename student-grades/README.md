# Student Grade Program

This program takes a student's score as input (between 0 and 100) and returns the corresponding grade based on predefined ranges. The grade system is as follows:

- **A**: 80 and above
- **B**: 60 to 79
- **C**: 50 to 59
- **D**: 40 to 49
- **E**: Below 40

The program checks if the score is within the valid range of 0 to 100 and provides a grade based on the score. If the score is outside this range, it outputs an error message.
