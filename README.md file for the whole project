# Student Grade Program

This program takes a student's score as input (between 0 and 100) and returns the corresponding grade based on predefined ranges. The grade system is as follows:

- **A**: 80 and above
- **B**: 60 to 79
- **C**: 50 to 59
- **D**: 40 to 49
- **E**: Below 40

The program checks if the score is within the valid range of 0 to 100 and provides a grade based on the score. If the score is outside this range, it outputs an error message.

# Speed Check Program

This program evaluates a driver's speed and determines the number of **demerit points** based on the speed limit. It also determines if the driver's license should be **suspended** due to accumulated points.

The main logic works as follows:

1. If the speed is within the limit, it returns `"Ok"`.
2. If the speed exceeds the limit, it calculates the demerit points based on how much the speed exceeds the limit.
3. If the demerit points exceed 12, the license is suspended.
4. If the demerit points are less than or equal to 12, it returns the number of points.

# Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)

This program calculates an individualâ€™s **Net Salary** based on the following inputs:

- **Basic Salary**: The employee's base salary before any deductions.
- **Benefits**: Additional benefits provided to the employee (optional, can be zero).
  
The program will calculate:

- **Gross Salary**: The total salary before deductions (Basic Salary + Benefits).
- **PAYE (Tax)**: Based on the KRA progressive tax rates.
- **NHIF Deductions**: Based on the NHIF deduction rates.
- **NSSF Deductions**: A fixed percentage (6%) of the gross salary for NSSF.

Finally, the **Net Salary** is computed after applying the deductions. The values are formatted for readability.
